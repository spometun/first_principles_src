<p><strong>The Holy Spirit Comes at Pentecost</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> When</span> the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> Suddenly</span> a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> They</span> saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> All</span> of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> Now</span> there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> When</span> they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> Utterly</span> amazed, they asked: "Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> Then</span> how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> Parthians,</span> Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> Phrygia</span> and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> (both</span> Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs &mdash; we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> Amazed</span> and perplexed, they asked one another, "What does this mean?"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> Some,</span> however, made fun of them and said, "They have had too much wine."</p>

<p><strong>Peter Addresses the Crowd</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> Then</span> Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> These</span> men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> No,</span> this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:</p>

<blockquote><span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> 'In</span> the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, young men will see visions, old men will dream dreams.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> Even</span> on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> I</span> will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> The</span> sun will be turned to darkness the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> And</span> everyone who calls the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will be saved.'</blockquote>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> "Men</span> of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> This</span> man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> But</span> God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> David</span> said about him:</p>

<blockquote>'I saw the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> Therefore</span> my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope,
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> because</span> you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>28</sup> You</span> have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.'</blockquote>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>29</sup> "Brothers,</span> I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>30</sup> But</span> he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> Seeing</span> what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> God</span> has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>33</sup> Exalted</span> to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>34</sup> For</span> David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,</p>

<blockquote>'The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand <span class="grouptogether"><sup>35</sup> until</span> I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'</blockquote>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>36</sup> "Therefore</span> let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>37</sup> When</span> the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>38</sup> Peter</span> replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>39</sup> The</span> promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off &mdash; for all whom the Lord our God will call."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>40</sup> With</span> many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>41</sup> Those</span> who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.</p>

<p><strong>The Fellowship of the Believers</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>42</sup> They</span> devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>43</sup> Everyone</span> was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>44</sup> All</span> the believers were together and had everything in common. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>45</sup> Selling</span> their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>46</sup> Every</span> day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>47</sup> praising</span> God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.</p>
