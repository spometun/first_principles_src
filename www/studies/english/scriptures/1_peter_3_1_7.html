They were submissive to their own husbands, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> like</span> Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> Husbands,</span> in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.</p>
