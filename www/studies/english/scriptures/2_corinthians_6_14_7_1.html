Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> What</span> harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> What</span> agreement is there between the temple of God and idols?
