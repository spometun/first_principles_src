	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> "I</span> am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> I</span> persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> as</span> also the high priest and all the Council can testify. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.

	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> "About</span> noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> I</span> fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me,</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	'<span class="jesuswords">Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?</span>'
	</blockquote>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> "'Who</span> are you, Lord?' I asked.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	'<span class="jesuswords">I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,</span>'
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>he replied. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> My</span> companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> "'What</span> shall I do, Lord?' I asked.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	"'<span class="jesuswords">Get up,</span>' the Lord said, '<span class="jesuswords">and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.</span>'
	</blockquote>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> "My</span> companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> "A</span> man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> He</span> stood beside me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very moment I was able to see him.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> "Then</span> he said: 'The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> You</span> will be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> And</span> now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.'"</p>
