Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> Look</span> at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> Who</span> of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?</span></p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>28</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">And</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>29</sup> Yet</span> I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>30</sup> If</span> that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> So</span> do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' <span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> For</span> the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>33</sup> But</span> seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>34</sup> Therefore</span> do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</span>"</p>
