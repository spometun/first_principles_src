		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> Is</span> Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> I</span> am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> so</span> no one can say that you were baptized into my name. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> (Yes,</span> I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.) <span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> For</span> Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel &mdash; not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</p>
