	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> We</span> have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> In</span> fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of Godâ€™s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> Anyone</span> who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> But</span> solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.</p>
	<p class="chapter">6</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> Therefore</span> let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> instruction</span> about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> And</span> God permitting, we will do so.</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> It</span> is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> who</span> have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> if</span> they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.</p>
