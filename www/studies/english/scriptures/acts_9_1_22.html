	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> Meanwhile,</span> Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> and</span> asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> As</span> he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> He</span> fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> "Who</span> are you, Lord?" Saul asked.</p>	
	<p>"<span class="jesuswords">I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,</span>" he replied. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">Now</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.</span>"</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> The</span> men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> Saul</span> got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> For</span> three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> In</span> Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "<span class="jesuswords">Ananias!</span>"</p>
	<p>"Yes, Lord," he answered.</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> The</span> Lord told him, "<span class="jesuswords">Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> In</span> a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.</span>"</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> "Lord,"</span> Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> And</span> he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> But</span> the Lord said to Ananias, "<span class="jesuswords">Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> I</span> will show him how much he must suffer for my name.</span>"</p>	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> Then</span> Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord &mdash; Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here &mdash; has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> Immediately,</span> something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> and</span> after taking some food, he regained his strength.</p>
	<p>Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> At</span> once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> All</span> those who heard him were astonished and asked, "Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> Yet</span> Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
