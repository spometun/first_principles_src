I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God's name and said: "You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> Was</span> it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> Must</span> we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?"</p>
