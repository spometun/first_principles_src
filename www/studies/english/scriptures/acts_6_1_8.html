	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> In</span> those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> So</span> the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> Brothers,</span> choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> and</span> will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word."</p>

	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> This</span> proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> They</span> presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> So</span> the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> Now</span> Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.</p>
