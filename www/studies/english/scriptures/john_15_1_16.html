No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.</span></p>

		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">I</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> If</span> anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> If</span> you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> This</span> is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.</span></p>

Now remain in my love. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> If</span> you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> I</span> have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> My</span> command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> Greater</span> love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> You</span> are my friends if you do what I command. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> I</span> no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> You</span> did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit &mdash; fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.</span></p>
