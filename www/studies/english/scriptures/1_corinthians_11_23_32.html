	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> For</span> I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> and</span> when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "<span class="jesuswords">This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.</span>" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> In</span> the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "<span class="jesuswords">This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.</span>" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> For</span> whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</p>
<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> Therefore,</span> whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>28</sup> A</span> man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>29</sup> For</span> anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>30</sup> That</span> is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> But</span> if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> When</span> we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.</p>
