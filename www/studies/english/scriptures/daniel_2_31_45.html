		<h1>Daniel 2:31-45</h1>
	</div>
	
	<div data-role="content" data-theme="c">
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> "You</span> looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue &mdash; an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> The</span> head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>33</sup> its</span> legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>34</sup> While</span> you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>35</sup> Then</span> the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>36</sup> "This</span> was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>37</sup> You,</span> O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; <span class="grouptogether"><sup>38</sup> in</span> your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>39</sup> "After</span> you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>40</sup> Finally,</span> there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron &mdash; for iron breaks and smashes everything &mdash; and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>41</sup> Just</span> as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>42</sup> As</span> the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>43</sup> And</span> just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>44</sup> "In</span> the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>45</sup> This</span> is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands &mdash; a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.</p>

<p>"The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy."</p>
