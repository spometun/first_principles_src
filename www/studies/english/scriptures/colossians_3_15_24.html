And be thankful. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> Let</span> the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> And</span> whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</p>
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> Wives,</span> submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</p>
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> Husbands,</span> love your wives and do not be harsh with them.</p>
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> Children,</span> obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.</p>
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> Fathers,</span> do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.</p>
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> Slaves,</span> obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> Whatever</span> you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> since</span> you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.</p>
