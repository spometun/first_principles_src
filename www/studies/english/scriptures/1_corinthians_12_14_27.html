If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> But</span> in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> If</span> they were all one part, where would the body be? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> As</span> it is, there are many parts, but one body.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> The</span> eye cannot say to the hand, "I don’t need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don’t need you!" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> On</span> the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> and</span> the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> while</span> our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> so</span> that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> If</span> one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> Now</span> you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.</p>
