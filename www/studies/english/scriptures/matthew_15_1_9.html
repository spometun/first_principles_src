<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> Then</span> some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> "Why</span> do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> Jesus</span> replied, "<span class="jesuswords">And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> For</span> God said, 'Honor your father and mother' and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> But</span> you say that if a man says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,' <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> he</span> is not to 'honor his father' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> You</span> hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">'These</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> They</span> worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'</span>"
