<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> King</span> Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter &mdash; Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> They</span> were from nations about which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had told the Israelites, "You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods." Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> He</span> had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> As</span> Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> his God, as the heart of David his father had been. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> He</span> followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> So</span> Solomon did evil in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>; he did not follow the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> completely, as David his father had done.</p>
<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> On</span> a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> He</span> did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.</p>
<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> The</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> Although</span> he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span> command.</p>
