		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> When</span> you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> having</span> canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> And</span> having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.</p>
