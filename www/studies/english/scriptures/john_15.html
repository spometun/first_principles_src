		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">I</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> He</span> cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> You</span> are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> Remain</span> in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.</span></p>

		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">I</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> If</span> anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> If</span> you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> This</span> is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.</span></p>
		
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">As</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> If</span> you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> I</span> have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> My</span> command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> Greater</span> love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> You</span> are my friends if you do what I command. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> I</span> no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> You</span> did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit &mdash; fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> This</span> is my command: Love each other.</span></p>
		
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">If</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> If</span> you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> Remember</span> the words I spoke to you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> They</span> will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> If</span> I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> He</span> who hates me hates my Father as well. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> If</span> I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> But</span> this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.'</span></p>
		
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">When</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> And</span> you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.</span>"</p>
