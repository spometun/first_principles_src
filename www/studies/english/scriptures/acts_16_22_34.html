	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> The</span> crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> After</span> they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> Upon</span> receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> About</span> midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> Suddenly</span> there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> The</span> jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>28</sup> But</span> Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>29</sup> The</span> jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>30</sup> He</span> then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> They</span> replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved &mdash; you and your household." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> Then</span> they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>33</sup> At</span> that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>34</sup> The</span> jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God &mdash; he and his whole family.</p>
