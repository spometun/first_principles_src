	<p><strong>Spiritual Gifts</strong></p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> Now</span> about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> You</span> know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> Therefore</span> I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> There</span> are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> There</span> are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> There</span> are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> Now</span> to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> To</span> one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> to</span> another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> to</span> another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> All</span> these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines.</p>

<p><strong>One Body, Many Parts</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> The</span> body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> For</span> we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body &mdash; whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free &mdash; and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> Now</span> the body is not made up of one part but of many. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> If</span> the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> And</span> if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> If</span> the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> But</span> in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> If</span> they were all one part, where would the body be? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> As</span> it is, there are many parts, but one body.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> The</span> eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> On</span> the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> and</span> the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> while</span> our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> so</span> that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> If</span> one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> Now</span> you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>28</sup> And</span> in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>29</sup> Are</span> all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>30</sup> Do</span> all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> But</span> eagerly desire the greater gifts.</p>

<p><strong>Love</strong></p>

<p>And now I will show you the most excellent way.</p>
