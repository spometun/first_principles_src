	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> While</span> Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> and</span> asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"</p>

	<p>They answered, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> So</span> Paul asked, "Then what baptism did you receive?"</p>
	
	<p>"John's baptism," they replied.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> Paul</span> said, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> On</span> hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> When</span> Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.</p>
