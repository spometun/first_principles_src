	<p><strong>Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial</strong></p>
	
	<p class="chapter">26</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> Then</span> Jesus told them, "<span class="jesuswords">This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written:</span></p>

<blockquote>
"<span class="jesuswords">'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</span>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> <span class="jesuswords">But</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>33</sup> Peter</span> replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>34</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">I</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">tell you the truth,</span>" Jesus answered, "<span class="jesuswords">this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>35</sup> But</span> Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same.</p>

<p><strong>Gethsemane</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>36</sup> Then</span> Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "<span class="jesuswords">Sit here while I go over there and pray.</span>" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>37</sup> He</span> took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>38</sup> Then</span> he said to them, "<span class="jesuswords">My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>39</sup> Going</span> a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "<span class="jesuswords">My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>40</sup> Then</span> he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "<span class="jesuswords">Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?</span>" he asked Peter. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>41</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">Watch</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>42</sup> He</span> went away a second time and prayed, "<span class="jesuswords">My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>43</sup> When</span> he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>44</sup> So</span> he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>45</sup> Then</span> he returned to the disciples and said to them, "<span class="jesuswords">Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>46</sup> Rise,</span> let us go! Here comes my betrayer!</span>"</p>

<p><strong>Jesus Arrested</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>47</sup> While</span> he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>48</sup> Now</span> the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>49</sup> Going</span> at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>50</sup> Jesus</span> replied, "<span class="jesuswords">Friend, do what you came for.</span>"</p>

<p>Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>51</sup> With</span> that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>52</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">Put</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">your sword back in its place,</span>" Jesus said to him, "<span class="jesuswords">for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>53</sup> Do</span> you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>54</sup> But</span> how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>55</sup> At</span> that time Jesus said to the crowd, "<span class="jesuswords">Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>56</sup> But</span> this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span>" Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.</p>

<p><strong>Before the Sanhedrin</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>57</sup> Those</span> who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>58</sup> But</span> Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>59</sup> The</span> chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>60</sup> But</span> they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.</p>

<p>Finally two came forward <span class="grouptogether"><sup>61</sup> and</span> declared, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>62</sup> Then</span> the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>63</sup> But</span> Jesus remained silent.</p>

<p>The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>64</sup> "<span class="jesuswords">Yes,</span></span> <span class="jesuswords">it is as you say,</span>" Jesus replied. "<span class="jesuswords">But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>65</sup> Then</span> the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>66</sup> What</span> do you think?"</p>

<p>"He is worthy of death," they answered.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>67</sup> Then</span> they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him <span class="grouptogether"><sup>68</sup> and</span> said, "Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?"</p>

<p><strong>Peter Disowns Jesus</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>69</sup> Now</span> Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>70</sup> But</span> he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>71</sup> Then</span> he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>72</sup> He</span> denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>73</sup> After</span> a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>74</sup> Then</span> he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!"</p>

<p>Immediately a rooster crowed. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>75</sup> Then</span> Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "<span class="jesuswords">Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.</span>" And he went outside and wept bitterly.</p>

<p><strong>Judas Hangs Himself</strong></p>

<p class="chapter">27</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> Early</span> in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> They</span> bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> When</span> Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> "I</span> have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood."</p>

<p>"What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> So</span> Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> The</span> chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> So</span> they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> That</span> is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> Then</span> what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:</p>

<blockquote>
"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> and</span> they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jesus Before Pilate</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> Meanwhile</span> Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"</p>

<p>"<span class="jesuswords">Yes, it is as you say,</span>" Jesus replied.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> When</span> he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> Then</span> Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> But</span> Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge &mdash; to the great amazement of the governor.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> Now</span> it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> At</span> that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> So</span> when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> For</span> he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> While</span> Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> But</span> the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> "Which</span> of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor.</p>

<p>"Barabbas," they answered.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> "What</span> shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked.</p>

<p>They all answered, "Crucify him!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> "Why?</span> What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate.</p>

<p>But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> When</span> Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> All</span> the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> Then</span> he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</p>

<p><strong>The Soldiers Mock Jesus</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> Then</span> the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>28</sup> They</span> stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>29</sup> and</span> then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>30</sup> They</span> spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> After</span> they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.</p>

<p><strong>The Crucifixion</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> As</span> they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>33</sup> They</span> came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <span class="grouptogether"><sup>34</sup> There</span> they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>35</sup> When</span> they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>36</sup> And</span> sitting down, they kept watch over him there. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>37</sup> Above</span> his head they placed the written charge against him: this is Jesus, the king of the jews. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>38</sup> Two</span> robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>39</sup> Those</span> who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads <span class="grouptogether"><sup>40</sup> and</span> saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>41</sup> In</span> the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>42</sup> "He</span> saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>43</sup> He</span> trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>44</sup> In</span> the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</p>

<p><strong>The Death of Jesus</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>45</sup> From</span> the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>46</sup> About</span> the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "<span class="jesuswords">Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</span>" &mdash; which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>47</sup> When</span> some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>48</sup> Immediately</span> one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>49</sup> The</span> rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>50</sup> And</span> when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>51</sup> At</span> that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>52</sup> The</span> tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>53</sup> They</span> came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>54</sup> When</span> the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>55</sup> Many</span> women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>56</sup> Among</span> them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</p>

<p><strong>The Burial of Jesus</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>57</sup> As</span> evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>58</sup> Going</span> to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>59</sup> Joseph</span> took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>60</sup> and</span> placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>61</sup> Mary</span> Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.</p>

<p><strong>The Guard at the Tomb</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>62</sup> The</span> next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>63</sup> "Sir,"</span> they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' <span class="grouptogether"><sup>64</sup> So</span> give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>65</sup> "Take</span> a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how." <sup>66</sup> So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.</p>

<p><strong>The Resurrection</strong></p>

<p class="chapter">28</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> After</span> the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> There</span> was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> His</span> appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> The</span> guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> The</span> angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> He</span> is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> Then</span> go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> So</span> the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> Suddenly</span> Jesus met them. "<span class="jesuswords">Greetings,</span>" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> Then</span> Jesus said to them, "<span class="jesuswords">Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.</span>"</p>
