		<h1>Acts 8:1-25</h1>
	</div>

	<div data-role="content" data-theme="c">
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> And</span> Saul was there, giving approval to his death.

	<p><strong>The Church Persecuted and Scattered</strong></p>
	
	<p>On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> Godly</span> men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> But</span> Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Philip in Samaria</strong></p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> Those</span> who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> Philip</span> went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> When</span> the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> With</span> shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> So</span> there was great joy in that city.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Simon the Sorcerer</strong></p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> Now</span> for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> and</span> all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "This man is the divine power known as the Great Power." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> They</span> followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> But</span> when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> Simon</span> himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> When</span> the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> When</span> they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> because</span> the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> Then</span> Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> When</span> Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money <span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> and</span> said, "Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> Peter</span> answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! <span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> You</span> have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> Repent</span> of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> For</span> I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> Then</span> Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me."</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> When</span> they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.</p>
