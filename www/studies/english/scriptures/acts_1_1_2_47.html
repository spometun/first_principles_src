<p><strong>Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven</strong></p>

<p class="chapter">1</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> In</span> my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> until</span> the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> After</span> his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> On</span> one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: "<span class="jesuswords">Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> For</span> John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> So</span> when they met together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> He</span> said to them: "<span class="jesuswords">It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> But</span> you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> After</span> he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> They</span> were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> "Men</span> of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."</p>

<p><strong>Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> Then</span> they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk from the city. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> When</span> they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> They</span> all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> In</span> those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty) <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> and</span> said, "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus &mdash;  <span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> he</span> was one of our number and shared in this ministry."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> (With</span> the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> Everyone</span> in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> "For,"</span> said Peter, "it is written in the book of Psalms,</p>

<blockquote>
"'May his place be deserted;
let there be no one to dwell in it,'
</blockquote>

<p>and,</p>

<blockquote>
"'May another take his place of leadership.'
</blockquote>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> Therefore</span> it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> beginning</span> from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> So</span> they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> Then</span> they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen <span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> to</span> take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> Then</span> they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.</p>

<p><strong>The Holy Spirit Comes at Pentecost</strong></p>

<p class="chapter">2</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> When</span> the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> Suddenly</span> a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> They</span> saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> All</span> of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> Now</span> there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> When</span> they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>7</sup> Utterly</span> amazed, they asked: "Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> Then</span> how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> Parthians,</span> Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> Phrygia</span> and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> (both</span> Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs &mdash; we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> Amazed</span> and perplexed, they asked one another, "What does this mean?"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> Some,</span> however, made fun of them and said, "They have had too much wine."</p>

<p><strong>Peter Addresses the Crowd</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> Then</span> Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> These</span> men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> No,</span> this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:</p>

<blockquote>
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> "'In</span> the last days, God says,
I will pour out my Spirit on all people.
Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
your young men will see visions,
your old men will dream dreams.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> Even</span> on my servants, both men and women,
I will pour out my Spirit in those days,
and they will prophesy.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>19</sup> I</span> will show wonders in the heaven above
and signs on the earth below,
blood and fire and billows of smoke.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>20</sup> The</span> sun will be turned to darkness
and the moon to blood
before the coming of the great and glorious day of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span>.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>21</sup> And</span> everyone who calls
on the name of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span> will be saved.'
</blockquote>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> "Men</span> of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> This</span> man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> But</span> God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> David</span> said about him:</p>

<blockquote>
"'I saw the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span> always before me.
Because he is at my right hand,
I will not be shaken.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> Therefore</span> my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
my body also will live in hope,
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> because</span> you will not abandon me to the grave,
nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>28</sup> You</span> have made known to me the paths of life;
you will fill me with joy in your presence.'
</blockquote>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>29</sup> "Brothers,</span> I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>30</sup> But</span> he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> Seeing</span> what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> God</span> has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>33</sup> Exalted</span> to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>34</sup> For</span> David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,</p>

<blockquote>
"'The <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span> said to my Lord:
"Sit at my right hand
<span class="grouptogether"><sup>35</sup> until</span> I make your enemies
a footstool for your feet."'
</blockquote>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>36</sup> "Therefore</span> let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>37</sup> When</span> the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>38</sup> Peter</span> replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>39</sup> The</span> promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off &mdash; for all whom the Lord our God will call."</p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>40</sup> With</span> many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>41</sup> Those</span> who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.</p>

<p><strong>The Fellowship of the Believers</strong></p>

<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>42</sup> They</span> devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>43</sup> Everyone</span> was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>44</sup> All</span> the believers were together and had everything in common. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>45</sup> Selling</span> their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>46</sup> Every</span> day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>47</sup> praising</span> God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.</p>
