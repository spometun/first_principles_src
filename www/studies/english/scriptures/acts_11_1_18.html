	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>1</sup> The</span> apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>2</sup> So</span> when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him <span class="grouptogether"><sup>3</sup> and</span> said, "You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them."</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>4</sup> Peter</span> began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened: <span class="grouptogether"><sup>5</sup> "I</span> was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>6</sup> I</span> looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air. <sup>7</sup> Then</span> I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.'</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>8</sup> "I</span> replied, 'Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>9</sup> "The</span> voice spoke from heaven a second time, 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.' <span class="grouptogether"><sup>10</sup> This</span> happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>11</sup> "Right</span> then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>12</sup> The</span> Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>13</sup> He</span> told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>14</sup> He</span> will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.'</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>15</sup> "As</span> I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>16</sup> Then</span> I remembered what the Lord had said: 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' <span class="grouptogether"><sup>17</sup> So</span> if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?"</p>
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>18</sup> When</span> they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life."</p>
