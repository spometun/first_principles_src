		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>22</sup> News</span> of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>23</sup> When</span> he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>24</sup> He</span> was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</p>
		<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>25</sup> Then</span> Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> and</span> when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</p>
