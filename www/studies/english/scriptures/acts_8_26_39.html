	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>26</sup> Now</span> an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Go south to the road &mdash; the desert road &mdash; that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." <span class="grouptogether"><sup>27</sup> So</span> he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, <span class="grouptogether"><sup>28</sup> and</span> on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>29</sup> The</span> Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it."</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>30</sup> Then</span> Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>31</sup> "How</span> can I," he said, "unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>32</sup> The</span> eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture:</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
	<span class="grouptogether"><sup>33</sup> In</span> his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth."
	</blockquote>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>34</sup> The</span> eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>35</sup> Then</span> Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.</p>
	
	<p><span class="grouptogether"><sup>36</sup> As</span> they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?" <span class="grouptogether"><sup>38</sup> And</span> he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. <span class="grouptogether"><sup>39</sup> When</span> they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.</p>
